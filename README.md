# 21_Days_of_CP

Its rightly said that, if you want to form a habit, try it for 21 days consecutively.

So for that matter, we are introducing a 21 day of code challenge. 

Here in daily two questions will be added and you have to share its solution in github itself in form of merge pull request.

If your logic is correct and efficient, then your pull request will be accepted. 

If your logic is incorrect your pull request will be considered as invalid.

So buckle and start coding.

I accepted 21 day of CP challenge. Did you???
